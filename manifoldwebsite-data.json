Despite impressive capabilities, VLMs often exhibit overconfidence; even when wrong. This project systematically evaluates model calibration across multiple datasets and architectures, probing the reliability of their self-assessed confidence. By analyzing when and why different models misjudge uncertainty, we aim to improve trust and interpretability in AI systems.",
