      "description": "MultiNet is an open-source benchmark designed to evaluate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on a diverse set of tasks spanning vision, language, and robotic control. By consolidating high-quality datasets and standardizing evaluation metrics, MultiNet enables the development of generalist AI systems that integrate multimodal understanding with real-world action capabilities.",
