Despite impressive capabilities, VLMs often exhibit overconfidence; even when wrong. This project systematically evaluates model calibration across multiple datasets and architectures, probing the reliability of their self-assessed confidence. By analyzing when and why different models misjudge uncertainty, we aim to improve trust and interpretability in AI systems.",

Rather than treating robots as fixed assemblies, Holon explores collectives of simple robotic cells that can reorganize their structure, function, and resource allocation in response to task demands and unexpected damage. Inspired by biological systems, the program targets three foundational capabilities: morphogenesis, the ability to form and transform global structure through local interactions; homeostasis, the ability to detect damage and preserve function through self-repair and reorganization; and metabolism, the ability to manage energy, material, and functional roles over time. Together, these capabilities aim to enable resilient, adaptive machines capable of long-duration operation in extreme and uncertain environments.",

Many critical space systems, such as large solar power arrays, orbital factories, and kilometer-scale telescopes, are too large or fragile to launch fully assembled and must instead be built in space. Existing approaches rely on centralized, single-purpose systems constrained by launch geometry and cannot scale to meet these demands. The program develops the core primitives required for autonomous in-space construction, including autonomous modular structure assembly, cooperative transportation and handoff of large objects, and safe navigation in dense orbital environments. Together, these capabilities form a technical foundation for persistent orbital construction sites, orbital shipyards, and future large-scale space infrastructure.",
